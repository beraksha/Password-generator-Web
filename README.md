# Password-generator-Web
A simple, interactive web-based password generator that creates secure passwords based on user preferences for length and character types. Originally inspired by a Python script, this version was adapted into a responsive web application using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- Customizable password length (default: 12, range: 4-50 characters).
- Options to include/exclude uppercase letters, digits, and symbols.
- Instant password generation on button click.
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., no character types selected).

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
  - For live reloading during development, use VS Code's Live Server extension:
    - Install the extension if needed.
    - Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
3. No additional dependencies or installations required; everything runs in the browser.

## Usage
1. Enter the desired password length in the input field.
2. Check/uncheck the boxes for character types (all are enabled by default).
3. Click "Generate Password" to create and display a new password.
4. Copy the generated password and use it securely.

> Example generated password: `A1b2C3!d4E5f6`

## Technologies Used
- Python: For basic coding.
- HTML5: For structure.
- JavaScript (ES6+): For core logic, random generation, and user interactions.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling via CDN (no build step required).
- VS Code with Live Server: Recommended for local development and preview.

## Project Development
This project started as a Python script for generating passwords and was adapted to a web page/app to explore front-end development. Orginally I wrote the Python code based on this concept (password generator) to help boost my Cyber Security learning journey by implementing one of it's concept with coding (primarily Python since I'm efficient in Python). And later on I thought of creating a simple, basic web page using the basic knowledge of HTML that I have and took help from various sources to write the HTML script.
